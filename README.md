# Archlinux-Ascend -  A setup that elevates your workflow

This repository contains the configuration files for my Arch Linux setup using the i3 window manager with multimonitor support. The configuration files are themed on the popular [Catppuccino](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) Mocha color scheme and include customizations for Polybar, Neofetch, Ranger, and Tmux.

## Installation

## Features

- Multimonitor support: The i3 configuration files in this repository are set up to support multiple monitors with different resolutions and orientations.

- Customized Polybar: The Polybar configuration file includes custom modules and icons to display information about the system, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network activity, and battery life.

- Neofetch: The Neofetch configuration file displays system information in a colorful ASCII art style.

- Ranger: The Ranger configuration file includes custom keybindings and a color scheme that matches the Catppuccin Mocha theme.

- Tmux: The Tmux configuration file includes custom keybindings and a status bar that matches the Catppuccin Mocha theme.

## Usage

To use these configuration files, simply copy them into the appropriate directories in your Arch Linux home directory. You may need to edit the configuration files to match your specific hardware and software setup.

Once you've copied the files into place, restart i3 by pressing Mod+Shift+R and the changes should take effect immediately.
